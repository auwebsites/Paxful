# Paxful
Paxful is an online marketplace which allows buyers and seller to meet online and trade bitcoins. Unlike most bitcoin exchanges, that match buyers and sellers in an automated process, Paxful allows users to communicate directly. Its sellers offer a wide variety of payment options and the built in escrow makes the process secure. Similar to LocalBitcoins, Paxful allows a wide range of payment methods and buying options which can’t be found on traditional cryptocurrency exchanges.
